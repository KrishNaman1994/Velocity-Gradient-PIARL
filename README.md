Velocity Gradient Model Enhanced PIARL

• The repository consists of Python implementation of the velocity gradient model enhanced physics-informed adaptive residual learning.

• The model is validated on simulated datasets exhibiting various traffic flow scenarios like the phantom traffic jams due to localised perturbation to an initially homogeneous traffic flow, shock waves and rarefaction waves

• The NGSIM density and speed data are used for validating the model on the real-world dataset. NGSIM_US101_Density_Data.txt - Vehicle Density on US-101 Highway Segment, between 7:50 am and 8:35 am, NGSIM. (Source: Dr. Allan Avila - https://github.com/Allan-Avila/Highway-Traffic-Dynamics-KMD-Code)
